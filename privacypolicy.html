                <h3>1. Visitors</h3>
                    <p>Like most website operators, Takaski.com collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how visitors use our website. From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our website.
                    Takaski.com also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on projects. We only disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>2. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Certain visitors to the Takaski.com website choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up for an account to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with Takaski.com – by purchasing products, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Takaski.com collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with our website. Takaski.com does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>3. Aggregated Statistics</h3>
                <p>
                    Takaski.com may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to our website. For instance, we may monitor the most popular projects. Takaski.com may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, we do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>4. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Takaski.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of our employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on our behalf or to provide services available at our website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using the Takaski.com website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Takaski.com will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Takaski.com discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Takaski.com, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of Takaski.com and have supplied your email address, we may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Takaski.com and our services. We primarily use our website to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Takaski.com takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

              <h3>5. Private Monetization Information</h3>
                <p>
                    Monetization transactions on the Takaski.com website are divided between public and private areas. The public area is viewable to everyone, but the private area is only viewable to the premium paid user and users that have agreed to a non-disclosure agreement and have been approved by Takaski.com. The information in this private area will never be viewed by us until the patents are submitted for evaluation, or a user with access reports a Terms of Use violation.</p>

            <li>
              <h3>6. Cookies</h3>
                <p>
                    A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Takaski.com uses cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of our website, and their website access preferences. Takaski.com visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using our website, with the drawback that certain features of our website may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>

            <li>
              <h3>7. Business Transfers</h3>
                <p>
                    If Takaski.com, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Takaski.com goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquiror of Takaski.com may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>8. Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
                <p>
                    Although most changes are likely to be minor, Takaski.com may occasionally change its Privacy Policy, and in our sole discretion. We will attempt to notify you of any changes through the website, but if you are not a registered user it is advisable to check this page for changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
